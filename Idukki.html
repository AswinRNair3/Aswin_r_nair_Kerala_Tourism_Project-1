            <p class="card-text">Idukki Arch Dam, an engineering marvel, is located in the South-Indian state of Kerala. It is an arch dam with a double curvature and is built on River Periyar. Precisely, the dam is constructed in a gorge between two hills, Kuravathi and Kuravan. It is at the height of about 550 feet and is a breathtaking sight in the otherwise rugged terrain along which has been built.

                With this height, it is one of the highest arch dams in Asia. Because of its massive size, the dam can be seen from quite some distance and the sight of the structure in between the granite hills is breathtaking. The surrounding is lush green, and the reservoir serves as a quick getaway for locals. As part of promoting hydel tourism, boating in the reservoir is open for tourists.
